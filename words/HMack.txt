Psychedelic Acoustics --
H-Mack gettin' loose with the music
Whether it be amplified or acoustic
Shine like star, deliverin' bars
I can make yo head nod with an acoustic guitar, come on
Think you on the same level y'all should try again
Acoustic instruments like the violin
They be sayin' Mack is crazy, we ain't never gettin bored a bruh
'Cause he's like a one man orchestra uh
I'ma keep the hypest facts
My vocals are acoustic, so let's hold a mic to that uh
Standin' up prouder, crushin' rappers into powder
Got the microphone to make it louder
Blastin' through the speakers y'all gettin' consumed
I'm in the studio with prime acoustics in my room yeah
And every time I finish rappin' leave the beat bent
Before I rhyme, had to setup the acoustic treatment
Yo my lyrics too astounding to y'all
Without the padding, my vocal tone will bounce off the wall, yeah
And that's something I just couldn't really let go
Gotta sound clean dry vocals with not echo yeah
Y'all know that I leave them amazed
Let's add some reverb, turn the acoustics to like a cave, yeah
I drop a verse like I'm in a massive church
Throughout the whole cathedral, my lyrics will disperse
I stand the edge of Grand Canyon then I let it echo, echo, echo
Got the mic up in my palm I never let go, let go, let go
Matter a fact the acoustics they be enhanced, -hanced, -hanced
Every time I'm rhymin' I'ma make you dance, dance, dance
H-Mack, they can't take my mic away
I be rockin' for the homie while he's puffin' on the J yeah
Every time I'm rhymin, man my lyrics are on point uh
My vocals is 'bout to get you higher than a joint, yeah
H-Mack, I'm bout to make it happen, I do more harm
I'm a work of art, just like that tattoo on your forearm
H-Mack man I'm breakin' down the notion, smooth as lotion
He be in the Hawaiian shirt, keep it open I be swangin' like your necklace
People they expect this
Known across the planet cause my lyrics are infectious yeah
Every time I grab the mic I'm here that rock ya fella
It don't matter if I'm over beats or spittin' acapella
Even with no music electric or acoustic I'm ready to do this
My vocal tone soothin' always improvin'
I'm not a rapper dawg, I'm a movement so let's make it happen
Difference between me and these other cats they lackin' passion uh
When I'm rhymin' they be goin' crazy
My demeanor is cool like your Window A-C
H-Mack man I spit how I live
Peace to the Homie who be noddin' sittin' outside the crib yeah
Ay, yo I be old school like a relic

Y'all can't lock me down I came to keep my flow free
Sorry I felt like makin' it happen, whenever I'm rappin'

When I just do what I do!
Mack, I be keepin' it true
Spread like the flu
Spread like the Covid
I got you doin like this with your shoulders
All of my lyrics they soundin' much colder
You know I still be rhymin' when older

Yo, top the position for me
Thanks so much for takin' time just to listen to me
I appreciate it much while you smokin' the Dutch
You got the J rolled proper and you grip on the crutch yeah
Doing what I feel and you know that it's stupendous
Your word was a capella so here's how we gon' end this
Acapella the word, I spit it absurd
I take the beat out cause I'm too sick to ever be cured
I can still feel the rhythm when I'm spittin' my vision
I don't write it down ahead I use my own intuition
I shine and then I glisten, rhyme when on my mission
Y'all know that my lyrics divine I cause collission
I'm crashin' spittin' with passion, I got you doin' the stank face
Even a capella with no drums to bang bass
----
Powerhouse --
Rappers is wack, I might just have to get rid of them
Check how I rock, hold up wait no, that's Obsidian
Mack going in, y'all know I'm dropping them poems

Shoutout to Obsidian, that be a black stone
Mack coming off the top, and I'm wrecked

Y'all know I gotta vibe, with the Obsidian necklace, got thе pride
Mack, imma hold it up and I get love
Not only thе necklace, you repping for the Cubs
Yeah, I can see it all up on the T-shirt
They said rap is dead, so this here is the rebirth
I'm bout to bring it off the top I'm bout to fling it
I be hitting everybody with the lyrics
Every time I'm doing all my rhymes off the top of the brain
You know it's coming from the spirit
Mack all up on it, and you know that I'm on next
I be blowing up, kinda like a bomb threat
You know I'm delivering the strong text
Matter of fact, all my lyrics way too complex
And it's complicated, dominate them

Y'all know I been the dude, I need a Complex interview
They better throw my name up on the website
When I be killing the game, yelling "dead right"
Come off the top with this
To do a rhyme for y'all is my honor, bro
Every time I leave these rappers down and out
They call me the powerhouse: Mitochondria
H-Mack, imma change the policy
Mitochondria be coming from biology
Harry Mack, you I'm winning and you know I'm about to triumph
Every time I'm rhyming, you know I'm dropping science
You know that I'm doing it well
I'm hotter than hell, I came to excel
Hold up, wait a minute, "cell"?
That's what the mitochondria lives inside
You know I spit with pride, I'm about to flip your vibe
I turn you upside down, all in the whip, we be riding around
H-mack in, my flow is amazing
Shoutout to the hommie repping GT-Racing
I can see it on the chair right now
H-Mack flowing with the flare right now
Come off the head with raps
GT-Racing with the red and black

You know that my lyrics the deepest, you know that I'm creeping
When I be rhyming, they stand away
I'm animated like anime
Mack, you know I'll spit it major soon
Dropping all of these major tunes
Hommie, I be animated kinda like the Pokémon
Charizard, hold up, Sailor Moon

And the bars I deliver, they be too infinite
Shoutout to y'all with the phat crew
Peace to the new friend with the tattoos

Shout to the hommie who just walked through the door
With an arm full of tattoos and a wife-beater
H-Mack y'all know imma throw it down
Peace to everybody that I'm seeing
I be coming off the top when I'm freeing
When I called him out, now he's leaving?
H-Mack y'all know I'm bout to put it down forever
When it comes to lyrics, I be way too clever
Coming off the tip of this, delivering the passion
Every time I'm rapping, I got my people laughing
And they know I'm a boss
And I never take a loss
Every time that I bust, man, it's about to get rough like a game of Lacrosse
Scored the goal, when I spit from the soul
I'm holding it down and I never fall off of this
Every time that I'm rhyming you know that I'm about to last long
Until I hit apocalypse, yeah
And y'all know that I'm heavy, I studied hip-hop kinda like a nerd
I think that was five
Hold up, wait, did I hit every word?
I be keeping it true
Can't nobody out there do what I do
Can't really remember all five
So lemme hit them off with a quick review
Well, first, I think I said this
Let me bring it back to remind y'all in the mix, yeah

First thing we said was Obsidian
Second word, that was Complex
Second in the row, I get rid of them
Third word, that was Mitochondria
Fourth word, yeah, that was Anime
Fifth word, yeah that was Lacrosse
I guess I got 'em all, so what can I say?
Mack I'm up on it and I'm rocking for the people
When it comes to kicking lyrics
Man they know my shit is lethal
I be live up on Omegle and I do it on the screen and shit
And every time I say I'm bout to rep you know I mean the shit
Every time I'm on it, I say ain't nobody like me

They talked about it but I did the shit
I'm livin' different, I'm rockin' for days
Your homie's walkin' away hold up
Yeah, when I rhyme, they turn me up loud yeah
We went from three to a two-person crowd
Either way, you know I'll blow your mind when I'm kickin' the true flows
Quickly shift from a trio to duo
I come off the top and y'all know I'm 'bout to slam
When it comes to lyricism, they know Harry Mack's the man
And I'm doin' this for all of y'all, my bars soundin' too raw
When I'm spittin', they be yellin' out, "Oorah!"
H-Mack, man, these rappers don't create at all
Basically, for Marines, that is like a matin' call
It's Harry Mack, about to break it down, I'm never playin' oorah
Yo, what y'all sayin'? "They like, it's one of our sayin's"
Yo, I'm comin' right off the tip of this, I'm 'bout to slam I'm the man
And I'm blendin' different colors like some crayons from Crayola
Rappers only get they records played through payola
The illest off the tip, I thought I motherfuckin' told ya yeah

So I'm givin' y'all the scoop, I'm loaded up with the ammo
Peace to the troops with the caps on in the camo yeah

One Time --
Everybody knows my style is greater
My brain is more advanced than a calculator uh
And I always be awesome
The mental calculator live-solvin' the problem yeah
There's no equation that my mind can't figure out
Rappers always findin' somethin' new to bicker 'bout
But not the Mackin', I'm attackin' any problem
I get to the answer by droppin' rap stanzas yeah
And y'all know I be one-two-one-two-testin'
Then again, I have fewer answers than questions
Always good to ask, I'm expandin' my mind
Makin' all these rappers throw tantrums in time yeah
Droppin' anthems on the drop of a dime
Rockin' it prime and often I shine
Doin' my thing, I'm the number-one runner uh

One more line so Mack can really blow your mind
Let's go
----
Simulation --
Every time I rhyme, I'll be spitting with the vision
I'll be flying over your head just like a pigeon
I don't write it, I come off the head with these things
I take flight, setting like a pigeon spreading his wings
I'm about to lift off, yeah
Taking off from the ground
Rapping for underground
Letting this thunder bound
Come around, spit the bar
Hit you hard, listen quick
Falling on top of your head
Just like pigeon shit
H Mack, man
I lock into the pocket
Once I get it moving, man
There ain't no way to stop it
I see the future like a profit
I know what's coming
And every time I'm rapping
I got every body runnin'
Oh, I'm about to bust off, yeah
In this other rappers, yo, I trust not
Whenever they be rhyming, I say, just stop
I'm in my element like pigeon by the bus stop, yeah
Eating on the bread crumbs
I flow off the head, son
Thinking that you on my level, you gonn' end up dead son
This is how it has to be, my rapping level mastery
I never do this thing right here too casually
Y'all know they're coming after me to stop me
I'm the freestyle innovator
Yeah, rappers this trapped up in the simulator
Oh, every single day I'm living, I be straight improving
They are trapped up in a simulator, the world's an illusion
H Mack I go ham
Who could beat me? no man
I'm up in the simulator so get with the program
Come right off the top with sweet bars, I beat hard
In fact, I leave rappers trapped in the VR
Universe when I spew a verse
I kick sick as raps here
I'm futuristic like the simulators in Black Mirror
So check the show out
I'm on my flow route
Is 'bout to go down
I will astound, I'm a killer clown
I'ma spill it now
Got you all laughing, spitting with passion
I'm making it happen
Getting it crackin'
As a matter of fact
When I be rhyming
Yo, you know that I got crazy haters
So much over over-beats
I bring more heat than radiators
H Mack, man
I go up on the skin just like a splinter
Necessary like a radiator in the winter
Yeah, and the way that I'm creating over beats
You can feel my mental radiating heat
Yo, my brain is storming
I'm performing, this is a warning
I'm adorned with plenty titles
Rap recital, shit is vital
I'ma smash this
Shout the chick in the green sweater with the glasses
H Mack, y'all know when I rhyme, I gotta run for words
When I tapped in you was overhead with the comforter
I was like "Hey yo, I'm 'bout to start throwing strum"
But there's a blanket over his head and something's going on
Hey, yo, the girl had the palm over your head like a basketball
When I first saw it, I had to laugh at y'all
Then I say, hum "Excuse me, can I rap for y'all?"
Now I'm like Katrina hurricane
I cause disaster, yo
I get it popping, I'm never stopping
When I be rhyming, y'all know I'm locked in
I do this for the club rise above, rock and subs
Y'all said pigeon but I'm rapping peace, so they call me dove
Rocking for my people bars, a lethal sharpest needle
Matter of fact I have no equal
If I take fight, I'm an eagle
And I've been rhyming 'til I'm bored
I'm leaving every other rapper in this fucking industry apart
I'm fully evolved, in fact, I never stop
When I rhyme, I give you more hardcore I swore like Hawks
Yeah, this shit gets scary
'Cause nowadays when I hope up on Omegle, they are like, "Is your name Henry?"
Heh, and whenever I'm spitting, "Yes, I is the man"
He was like, "I think I follow you on Instagram"
Go ahead an kick a bar then
Let the rappers hungry but see their remake, they're starving
I really am a martian, I'm good with this rapping
Shout the homie watching leaning in, I see your black ring
Yeah, the exact thing I noticed
I help to keep you focused
They go crazy, this rappers sitting in the chair
Something like the baby on the painting on the wall behind your heads
Yeah, every time I rhyme I keep on spitting 'til I'm dead
Oh, hey yo! Y'all know I'm 'bout to drive 'em truly mad
I got patterns like the white and blue plaid
The checkerboard up on the chair, making y'all aware
I never prepare when I be rhyming I'm getting it cracking just like a snare
I'm doing my thing, they're loving the energy that I'ma gon' bring
When I be rhyming y'all know that I'm shining or something like playing
Every Mack I'll make a necklace
You know I get reckless, I'm rapping from here after Texas
I'm moving too fast, hey
Every time that I rap, I'ma get you off your ass, now check it
The bars I deliver is done with the passion
This here is the moment for your crazy ass reaction, lets go
----

Yeah, but when you hear 'im rhyme, you gon' understand
I'm a alien for real, rappers got the underhand
It can't be earthly, they heard me, I cut you like surg'ry
Every time I rhyme, I'm on a word spree
I'm from another planet, all my lyrics gigantic, they in the shuffle
Only way to visit me is space shuttle
Yeah, I told you I'm a alien, I figured that was clear
Wanna hit my planet, you gon' have to crack the atmosphere
Yeah, I grip the mic and then I kill a phrase
I mean, I ain't even from the fuckin' Milky Way
I ain't from the same galaxy that y'all livin' in
And you can tell when the rhymes, I start spittin' them
Do what I'm feelin' when I'm on it, feel the wrath
Ay, I'm addin' up my lyrics like I'm doin' math
Hold up, and when I'm spittin', I'm makin' people listen
It's like I'm doin' math, how I rep for my division

Trigonometry, calculus, they can't challenge us
Harry Mack, they love the style I bust
They know now it's us, yeah, my power's up, 9000+
Matter fact, I go beyond it
Every time I rhyme, you know my flow is honest
Harry Mack, I'm blazin', lyrics amazin'
Yeah, I'm a problem, a tricky equation
Yeah, all these other rappers, they sound too faulty
They can't get my math 'cause there's no way to solve me
Yeah, ayo, and y'all know we 'bout to permeate
Yeah, need no protractor to hit you with the angle of the flow rapper
Who causes mo' disaster
Yeah, when I'm finished rhymin', no one's goin' after
It's a closed chapter, y'all better believe it

Yeah, ayo, y'all know that I be rockin' it clear
You said bottle? That's funny, well, I got one right here
H-yeah, H-Mack, y'all know that these rappers never violated
Keep a bottle at the side 'cause I'm stayin' hydrated
And when I'm rhymin', man, they knowin' I'm the fly guy
The orange theory water bottle that you get for DriTri
H-Mack, yo, I be the role model

H-Mack, man, you know I'm gettin' free from the mind
H-yeah, y'all know that I'm really gettin' loose when I spaz
Man, I'ma crack the beats like a bottle made o' glass
Hold up, and y'all know that when I'm rockin', I'm tight

Then again, like bottle o' coke, my flow, you enjoy
Crack a bottle on these rappers, man, they gettin' destroyed
Hold up, I spit it sicker 'cause my brain's workin' quicker
Like light, I flicker, get you twisted like a bottle o' liquor
Hey, Harry Mack, y'all know my flow is vital
Old school like ceremonies that are tribal
Like bottles, rappers recycled
I'm here, spittin' it clear, I'm makin' rappers back down
Could tell you liked hip hop from the pictures in your background
Yeah, and they can tell the way that I slam
I see you got the image of that Kendrick album called Damn
H-Mack, when I start to rhyme, it ain't no way to stop me
Plus I'm pretty sure you got that cover from A$AP Rocky
H-Mack, I drop a verse, my flow is unrehearsed
In fact, I can see that your musical taste is diverse
Hold up, and when I'm on it, yo, I'm honored to say

Stereotype, Pterodactyl, Explore --
Play me through your speakers, get your stereo hype
I build my own path, Mack is not no stereotype
Ayo, y'all know these rappers don't share no love at all
Fuck a stereotype, I'm never judging y'all
Ayo, you know I come off the top when I'm kickin' the dopest rhymes
Yeah, never be stereotypin', I'm keepin' a open mind
Yeah, y'all know that I'm doin' this for hip hop lovers
Fuck a stereotype, can't judge a book by its cover

I'm blowin' your mind when I'm kickin' these hot flows
Yo, hold up, they ill flows Yo, hold up, they phat flows
Yo, hold up, they fly flows, they like pterodactyls
I'm over your head, ay, Mack off the top kickin' rhymes galore
Matter fact, my lyrics so old school
They be comparin' me to the dinosaurs
Yeah, every time I do it, pop on stage and the fans
They be beggin' for us, hey
Fly like a pterodactyl, sharp like the tail of a stegosaurus
Ay, Mack off top when I do this
Y'all know I'm comin' through just to flex
Ay, matter fact, they come up short
Kinda like the arms all up on a T-Rex
Ay, I'ma do my thing right now when I freestyle, homie that's the drastic part
Ay, Mack is a monster, I break out my cage in Jurassic Park
Ay, do my shit and everyone is flippin'
Ay, ay, when I kick a rhyme, I got my people trippin'
Ay, ay, give you just a taste, then I give you more
Ay, stereotype, pterodactyl; well, I explore
Ay, when I'm explorin', they be blown away from explorations
Harry Mack, I wreck your mental state with all these wet creations
I'm goin' deeper than ever, I'm droppin' mad facts
He got the fitted cap, I got the snapback
Both of 'em flipped backwards, y'all know what we all about
Anything I see and anything I hear, I call it out
Any time I'm rappin', man, I leave these rappers wasted
He said cat, dog, somethin' else, I said, "Not so basic!"
So he said, "All right, give me a second
Let me come through with some better words!"
Yeah, then he hit me once again, comin' with the clever verbs
The adjectives, the adverbs and the nouns
Every time I grab the mic, I'm about to throw down
Doin' what I feel and you know that I'm a god
Peace to the homie listenin' AirPods
I can see 'em all in your ears
Every time I rhyme, you know I spit it clear
H-Mack, y'all know that I'm fully evolved
Yeah, I see the clothes hangin' on your wall
Ay, even if rappers was the clothes that's on your wall right now
They still couldn't hang with me, I'd have 'em fallin' down
Yeah, I said I spit the shit that's lethal
I make you cover your face when spittin' bars up on Omegle
For me to blow your mind, it truly is essential
You so blown away, you got your fingers on your temples let's go
